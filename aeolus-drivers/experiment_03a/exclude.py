This module provides the "exclude_nodes()" method which is responsible for
filtering nearest neighbor results returned from "KDTree.query()".

The idea is to prove the feasability of making accuracy improvements in our
interpolation methods by filtering outliers in a naive way prior to computing
our estimation.
